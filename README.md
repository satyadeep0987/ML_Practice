# Machine Learning Practice Repo

1. Creating Virtual Env on Mac:

    * Creating a virtual env for your prject or for practice is a best practice a while going forward we are  going to install various packages which we might not reqire for all our project and installing directly into the machine is not good as they migh affect the loacl system. So better to have a local machine and do all your **Experiments**.

    * Check whether python is install or not:
        ```python
        python3 --version
        ```

        If not, then download nad install it from below link:

        [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

    * Checking PIP is there or not:

        ```python
        pip3 --version
        ```
    * Installing **virtaulenv**

        ```python
        pip3 install virtualenv
        ```
    * Creating a Virtual Environment:

        ```python
        python3 -m venv Virtual_Env
        ```
2. Create a git repo so that you can track your progress in a better way and can show your work to othrs.
And its beter to add two file i.e **README.md** where you can put all your instruction of the process what is there and what you are going to do and **.gitignore** to exclude unessary folders and file to be tracked into the repo.
